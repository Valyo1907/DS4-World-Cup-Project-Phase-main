⚽ Igniting Passion. Creating Champions.

Football is a game of emotion, but success is a game of numbers. In this project, our team (Valyo, Berk & Jean-Philippe) analyzes historical World Cup data to decode the DNA of a champion.

Moving from opinion to evidence, we merge and analyze diverse Kaggle datasets to answer key questions:

🔍 Evolution: How has the game changed over decades?

🏆 Success Factors: What statistically separates winners from the rest?

🔮 The Future: What can history tell us about the expanded 2026 World Cup?

This is where passion meets data analysis—transforming raw numbers into clear football insights.
